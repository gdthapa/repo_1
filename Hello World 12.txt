Just a couple of years ago Richard Branson quoted "One day, offices will be a thing of the past". What may have seemed vague to some at that time, but this is the actual secenraio today. His prediction is the reality of the present! Now, some still think that they don't need virtual or remote team in their organization just because they work out of the same office space. But, is that really true? We live in a hyper-modern, technology-driven world and in one way or another we all have worked remotely. You have taken a day to work from home, sent an urgent email while you were on your way to work, or had a video conference with collegues across different time zone; so you see we all are remote/virtual workers.
